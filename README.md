## Readme

Moodle Adminer is based on the great tool adminer (www.adminer.org).
The main advantage of this plugin is, it can handle different types of database.
So it works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MSSQL.

### Installation:
To install Moodle Adminer just copy the folder "adminer" into your moodle/local/adminer.
After that you have to go to http://your-moodle/admin (Site administration -> Notifications) to trigger the installation process.

### Using:
To use Moodle Adminer go to "Site administration" -> "Server" -> "Moodle Adminer".

### Config-Setting
While the administrator is desired on development and test instances, it can sometimes be undesirable for the site admin to have direct DB access on production environments. For this use case, the following setting can be made in config.php to prevent access.

```
$CFG->local_adminer_disabled = true;
```
